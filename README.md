- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AuthZeroMichael
- Straight up front, I'm not a developer (not nearly smart enough for that)
- Looking to be a point of contact for devs who are interested in the Auth0 platform.
- Reach out to me for info on CIAM, SSO connections, Multifactor Authentication and anything else in the Identity and Access Management sphere. Building identity is hard, so let us build it for you
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... email: michael.chon@auth0.com
Territories covered: North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Kansas, Illinois, North Dakota, South Dakota
